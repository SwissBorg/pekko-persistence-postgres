![Pekko Persistence Postgres]({{ 'assets/project-logo.png' | absolute_url }})

The Pekko Persistence Postgres plugin allows for using Postgres database as backend for [Pekko Persistence](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/typed/persistence.html) and [Pekko Persistence Query](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/persistence-query.html).

pekko-persistence-postgres writes journal and snapshot entries to a configured PostgreSQL store. It implements the full pekko-persistence-query API and is therefore very useful for implementing DDD-style application models using Pekko and Scala for creating reactive applications.

Itâ€™s been originally created as a fork of [Akka Persistence JDBC plugin](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-jdbc) 4.0.0, focused on PostgreSQL features such as partitions, arrays, BRIN indexes and others. Many parts of this doc have been adopted from the original [project page](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/4.0.0/index.html).

The main goal is to keep index size and memory consumption on a moderate level while being able to cope with an increasing data volume.

## Installation

To use `pekko-persistence-postgres` in your SBT project, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.swissborg" %% "pekko-persistence-postgres" % "0.1.0"
```

For a maven project add:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.swissborg</groupId>
    <artifactId>pekko-persistence-postgres_2.13</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
to your `pom.xml`.

> :warning: Since Pekko [does not allow mixed versions](https://nightlies.apache.org/pekko/docs/pekko/1.0.2/docs/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#mixed-versioning-is-not-allowed) in a project, Pekko dependencies are marked a `Provided`. This means that your application `libraryDependencies` needs to directly include Pekko as a dependency. The minimal supported Pekko version is 1.0.0.
